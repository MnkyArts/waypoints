# --------- Notes ---------
# If you need to set a block / item, see here for valid values: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
# Important: Do not use Materials with the 'LEGACY_' prefix
# Intervals are always in game ticks, which means 1 second = 20 game ticks
# When you need to set a distance, it is always in blocks
